## Overview
**RunOwn** is an open-source project for a mobile/web running platform that combines Strava-like tracking with virtual territory ownership and blockchain-based crypto rewards. Users claim real-world running routes, compete to own them, and earn mined cryptocurrency for wins. This repo serves as the central hub for planning, task tracking, and collaboration—**no code yet**, but structured for rapid development.

Built for a bootstrapped founder: leverages free/open-source tools to launch an MVP without upfront costs.

- **Repo Structure** (High-Level Folders for Future Code):
  - `/docs`: Documentation, wireframes, user stories.
  - `/tasks`: Markdown files for categorized task boards (e.g., `crypto-tasks.md`, `frontend-tasks.md`).
  - `/design`: Figma exports, route maps.
  - `/roadmap`: Milestones in issues.
  - `README.md`: This file.

Fork, star, and contribute! Track progress via [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/username/runown-app/projects/1) (set up a Kanban board for tasks).

## Features
- **Virtual Territory Ownership**: GPS-mapped routes users claim and defend.
- **Competitive Challenges**: Head-to-head runs with metrics-based overtakes.
- **Crypto Rewards**: Opt-in device mining during runs; winners get pooled RunCoins (ERC-20 tokens).
- **Social Integration**: Leaderboards, clans, live notifications.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (app) + Next.js (web).
- **Backend**: Firebase/Supabase (auth, DB, real-time).
- **Blockchain**: Polygon (tokens), Web3.js (integration), open-source mining libs.
- **Mapping**: OpenStreetMap + GPS APIs.
- **Tools**: GitHub for collab, Figma for design.

## Getting Started (Pre-Code Phase)
1. **Clone/Fork**: `git clone https://github.com/username/runown-app.git`
2. **Setup**: No code yet—focus on tasks below. Use GitHub Issues for discussions.
3. **Contribute**: Pick a task, create a branch (e.g., `feat/crypto-wallet`), add your work to `/docs` or tasks files, and open a PR.
4. **Local Dev (Future)**: Once code lands, `npm install` in subfolders; env vars for API keys.

## Task Breakdown
Tasks are divided into categories for modular development. Each category has a dedicated Markdown file in `/tasks/` with detailed subtasks, assignees (TBD), and status (To Do/In Progress/Done). Use GitHub Issues to claim and track.

### 1. Blockchain Integration
Focus: Smart contracts for ownership, token minting, and on-chain verification.
- [ ] Design ERC-20 RunCoin contract (Polygon deployment).
- [ ] Implement territory NFT mechanics (claim/transfer via runs).
- [ ] Set up oracle for GPS data off-chain verification.
- [ ] Audit contract security (use free tools like Slither).
- [ ] Integrate with backend for event emissions (e.g., challenge won → token transfer).

### 2. Crypto Rewards & Mining
Focus: Device-based mining and reward distribution—zero-cost entry.
- [ ] Research mobile-friendly PoW mining lib (e.g., CryptoNight JS).
- [ ] Build opt-in mining script (throttle for battery; run during GPS sessions).
- [ ] Create reward criteria logic (e.g., streak wins → treasury split).
- [ ] Pool mined BTC/ETH into treasury wallet.
- [ ] User wallet integration (MetaMask/Phantom connect).
- [ ] Redemption flow: Swap RunCoins for crypto or in-app perks.

### 3. Frontend (App & Web)
Focus: User-facing UI/UX for runs, maps, and social features.
- [ ] Wireframe core screens (login, map view, challenge modal) in Figma.
- [ ] Set up React Native project skeleton.
- [ ] Implement GPS tracking component (with start/stop run).
- [ ] Build territory map view (interactive routes with ownership badges).
- [ ] Design challenge UI (notifications, leaderboards).
- [ ] Add wallet connect button and reward display.
- [ ] Responsive web version with Next.js.

### 4. Backend & API
Focus: Serverless core for data sync and logic.
- [ ] Setup Firebase project (auth, Firestore for user/routes data).
- [ ] API endpoints: `/claim-territory`, `/challenge-run`, `/verify-metrics`.
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions (e.g., live run updates via WebSockets).
- [ ] Data models: Users, Territories, Runs, Challenges.
- [ ] Integrate mining webhook for reward triggers.
- [ ] Basic analytics (run stats aggregation).

### 5. DevOps & Infrastructure
Focus: Deployment, security, and scaling.
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (lint/test/deploy).
- [ ] Environment config (dotenv for keys).
- [ ] Security audit: GPS spoofing prevention, rate limiting.
- [ ] Hosting: Vercel for web, Expo for app builds.
- [ ] Monitoring: Free Sentry for errors.

### 6. Testing & QA
Focus: Ensure reliability from day one.
- [ ] Unit tests for reward logic (Jest).
- [ ] E2E tests for run flows (Detox for mobile).
- [ ] Blockchain testnet simulations (Ganache).
- [ ] User testing plan (beta runners via TestFlight).
- [ ] Accessibility checks (maps for color-blind).

### 7. Marketing & Community
Focus: Launch hype without budget.
- [ ] Draft landing page copy and social teasers.
- [ ] Community guidelines for contributors.
- [ ] Reddit/Twitter outreach plan (r/running, #Web3Fitness).
- [ ] Airdrop strategy for early testers.
- [ ] Analytics for user acquisition (Google Analytics free tier).

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Core tasks in Blockchain, Crypto, and Backend. MVP: Claim a route.
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Frontend polish + Testing. Beta app release.
- **Phase 3 (Ongoing)**: Full features, marketing push, mainnet launch.
